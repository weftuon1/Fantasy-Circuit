# Fantasy-Circuit
AOOP Project at NCTU
- Used Visual C++ to design and implement the circuit analyzer which provides an Graphical user interface (GUI) to draw the specific circuit schema
- Analyzed the circuit schema by solving the node equations and plotted the result voltage waveform for any circuit node
